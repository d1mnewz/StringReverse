# StringReverse
//to do
i faced this problem when i was looking for technical interview tasks examples

well, i did some calculations for different methods. 


Concluding: 
- logic for XOR method is a bit complex and it makes code unsupportable.
- 


also the most optimal solution was
static void Main ()
{
  Console.WriteLine("!dlroW, olleH");
}
